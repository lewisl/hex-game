This is a nim version of the game of Hex. It was translated from c++ based on an assignment from the online course from the University of California Santa Cruz called C (and C++) for everyone. The assignment asked for a naive game playing approach based on simulating the computer's move and choosing the highest winning outcome for each test move. Sometimes, the simulation finds the special move that thwarts the human player, but often does not. The c++ code was, naturally, based heavily on classes: one for creating a graph and the other for creating the hex game board and governing the game play in a terminal. I am sure my c++ code was not great. It also makes for a somewhat awkward conversion to nim, though the nim code is much more satisfying. Perhaps because my c++ code was ragged, the nim version runs in 1/2 the time. The nim executable is twice as large (not that this matters at all) and the high water mark of memory while running is 25% greater for the nim executable than the c++ executable.

Still, this is a great outcome for nim: faster running, much clearer code, and entirely reasonable file size and memory usage.
